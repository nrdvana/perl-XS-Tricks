Perl XS Tricks
==============

This is a collection of resources for learning how to make great XS integrations.
It assumes you already are familiar with writing C, and at least a little familiar
with writing XS.  It's basically a collection of all things I've tried in my XS
modules over the years which resulted in really slick API experiences for the
perl-side.
